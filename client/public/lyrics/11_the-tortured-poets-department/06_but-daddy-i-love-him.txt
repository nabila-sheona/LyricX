[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, what a mess
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse for a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door on my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', "But Daddy, I love him
I'm havin' his baby"
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

[Pre-Chorus]
"Stay away from her," the saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just screeching tires of true love

[Chorus]
And now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', "But Daddy, I love him
I'm havin' his baby"
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you somethin' right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you somethin' 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry and undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy, and all of his wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
That's just white noise, that's just my choice

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that
I bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over

[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And no, you can't come to the weddin'
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you somethin' right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy, and all of his wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
That's just white noise, that's just my choice

[Outro]
Screamin', "But Daddy, I love him
I'm having his baby"
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
But oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
