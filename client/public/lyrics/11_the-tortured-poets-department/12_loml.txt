[Verse 1]
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I've felt a glow like this never before and never since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
And you suit and tie in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-off guy
You holy ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A calm man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
I've felt a hole like this never before and ever since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal your girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could unrecall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should I let it stay buried?

[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
I'll never leave, never mind
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arsons match your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life
