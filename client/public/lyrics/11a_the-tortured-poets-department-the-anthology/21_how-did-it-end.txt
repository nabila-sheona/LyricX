[Intro]
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct
This post-mortem
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsmen
Our maladies were such
We could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birth right became foreign

[Chorus]
Come one come all
It's happ'nin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no-one
'Cept all of our friends
We must know
How did it end?
(Uh-oh, uh-oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learn the right steps to different dances (Oh, oh-oh)
And fell victim to interlopers glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins (Oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear?
They called it all off
One gasp and then
How did it end?

[Bridge]
Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G

[Pre-Chorus]
It's happening again
How did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand
How did it end?

[Chorus]
Come one come all
It's happening again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no-one
Except all of our friends
But I still don't know
How did it end?
