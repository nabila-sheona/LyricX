        lyrics: `
            Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
            Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
            Loving him is like trying to change your mind
            Once you're already flying through the free fall
            Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
            Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
            Missing him was dark gray, all alone
            Forgetting him was like trying to know
            Somebody you never met
            But loving him was red
            Loving him was red
            Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
            Was right there in front of you
            Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
            To your old favorite song
            Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
            And realizing there's no right answer
            Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
            That love could be that strong
            Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
            Missing him was dark gray, all alone
            Forgetting him was like trying to know
            Somebody you never met
            But loving him was red
            Oh, red
            Burning red
            Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
            Tell myself it's time now gotta let go
            But moving on from him is impossible
            When I still see it all in my head
            In burning red
            Burning, it was red
            Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known
            Missing him was dark gray, all alone
            Forgetting him was like trying to know
            Somebody you never met
            'Cause loving him was red
            Yeah, yeah, red
            Burning red
            And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
            Comes back to me, burning red
            Yeah, yeah
            His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
